[![Architecture](https://github.com/brave-chat/brave-chat/blob/main/docs/static/images/architecture.png)](https://github.com/brave-chat/brave-chat-server)

A Fully Async based backend for [Brave Chat](https://github.com/brave-chat/brave-chat). It is a multi-model server that is fully functional and supports all the usual messaging app capabilities such as of one-on-one (private) and room messaging. It enables users to send text and multimedia messages(e.g. images). Also, users can freely create, join, and leave chat rooms where everyone can message each other.

## Installation with Make

The best way to configure, install main dependencies, and run the project is by using `make`. So, make sure you have `make` installed and configured on your machine. If it is not the case, head over to [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows) on stackoverflow to install it on windows, or [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11494522/installing-make-on-mac) to install it on Mac OS.

Having `make` installed and configured on your machine, you can now run `make` under the root directory of this project to explore different available commands to run:

```sh
make

Please use 'make <target>' where <target> is one of:

venv                     Create a virtual environment
install                  Install the package and all required core dependencies
run                      Running the app locally
deploy-deta              Deploy the app on a Deta Micro
clean                    Remove all build, test, coverage and Python artifacts
lint                     Check style with pre-commit
test                     Run tests quickly with pytest
test-all                 Run tests on every Python version with tox
coverage                 Check code coverage quickly with the default Python
build                    Build docker containers services
up                       Spin up the containers
down                     Stop all running containers
```

### 1. Create a virtualenv

```sh
make venv
```

### 2. Activate the virtualenv

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```sh
make install
```

**Note**: _This command will automatically generate a `.env` file from `.env.example`, uninstall the old version of poetry on your machine, then install latest version `1.2.2`, and install the required main dependencies._

### 4. Setup a SingleStore account

You can refer to [this tutorial](https://dev.to/wiseai/a-deep-dive-into-connecting-fastapi-with-singlestore-2dn8#setting-up-singlestore) to create a SingleStore account and a MySQL `chat` database.

### 5. Set your SingleStore Credentials

Fill in the following environment variables in your .env file accordingly:

```yaml
# Database
SINGLESTORE_USERNAME=admin
SINGLESTORE_PASSWORD=<database password>
SINGLESTORE_HOST=<database name>
SINGLESTORE_PORT=3306
SINGLESTORE_DATABASE=<database name>
```

### 6. Setup a Redis account

Create a free account on [Redis Cloud](https://redis.info/try-free-dev-to).

### 7. Set your Redis Cloud Credentials

Set the following environment variables in your .env file according to your account credentials:

```yaml
# REDIS
# USER IN REDIS CLOUD
REDIS_USERNAME=default
# DATABASE PASSWORD
REDIS_PASSWORD=<database password>
# REDIS HOST
REDIS_HOST=<redis url>
# REDIS PORT
REDIS_PORT=15065
```

### 8. Generate a secret key

Create a free account on [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/), and create a new project.

### 9. Set your Deta project key

Set the following environment variable in your `.env` file according to your project key value:

```yaml
# Deta
DETA_PROJECT_KEY=
```

### 10. Generate a secret key

Generate a secret key using openssl and update its env var in .env file.

```sh
openssl rand -hex 128

```

```yaml
# App config:
JWT_SECRET_KEY=afa1639545d53ecf83c9f8acf4704abe1382f9a9dbf76d2fd229d4795a4748712dbfe7cf1f0a812f1c0fad2d47c8343cd1017b22fc3bf43d052307137f6ba68cd2cb69748b561df846873a6257e3569d6307a7e022b82b79cb3d6e0fee00553d80913c1dcf946e2e91e1dfcbba1ed9f34c9250597c1f70f572744e91c68cbe76
DEBUG=False
```

### 11. Run The Project Locally

```sh
make run
```

## Running locally with Compose v2

First thing first, to run the entire platform, you have to clone the `brave-chat` submodule using the following command:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Once that done, make sure your have [compose v2](https://github.com/docker/compose) installed and configured on your machine, and run the following command to build the predefined docker services(make sure you have a .env file beforehand):

**Using Make**

```sh
make build
```

or simply running:

```
docker compose build
```

Once that is done, you can spin up the containers:

**Using Make**

```sh
make up
```

or running:

```
docker compose up
```

Wait untill the client service become available:

```sg
brave-chat-server-client-1      | Starting the development server...
```

You can stop the running containers but issuing the following command on a separate terminal session:

```
make down
```

## Cloud Deployments

## Deta Micros (Not Possible)

To use the Deta version of the APIs you'll need to create a Deta account.

[![Deploy on Deta](https://button.deta.dev/1/svg)](https://go.deta.dev/deploy?repo=https://github.com/brave-chat/brave-chat-server)

#### Deta CLI (Not Possible)

Make sure you have Deta cli installed on your machine. If it is not the case, just run the following command(on a linux distro or Mac):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.deta.dev/cli.sh | sh
```

Manually add `/home/<user_name>/.deta/bin/deta` to your path:

```sh
PATH="/home/<user_name>/.deta/bin:$PATH"
```

Now you can deploy the app on a Deta Micro:

```sh
make deploy-deta
```

You can then use the Deta UI to check the logs and the URL the API is hosted on.

**Notes**:

- _Make sure your `.env` file is being provided with valid env vars values accordingly._

- _The `main.py` file is used as an entry point for deta. Same goes for `requirements.txt`._

- _Deta Micros are limited to 512MB per deployment._

### Heroku

[![Deploy on Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/brave-chat/brave-chat-server)

#### Heroku CLI (Not Possible)

Before going any further, make sure you already installed and configured the Heroku CLI on you machine. If it is not the case, you can install it on Ubuntu using the followig command:

```sh
sudo wget -qO- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
```

Now, you need to install the Heroku container registry plugin:

```sh
heroku plugins:install heroku-container-registry
```

Once that completed, Login to your registry:

```sh
heroku container:login
```

Set your env variables from the `.env` file:

```sh
xargs -a .env -I {} heroku config:set {}
```

Log in to the Heroku Docker registry before.

```sh
heroku auth:token | docker login --username=_ registry.heroku.com --password-stdin
```

Build your container images:

```sh
docker build tag lb -f Dockerfile.haproxy
docker tag app1 registry.heroku.com/brave-chat-server_app1/web
docker tag app2 registry.heroku.com/brave-chat-server_app2/web
docker tag app3 registry.heroku.com/brave-chat-server_app3/web
docker tag app4 registry.heroku.com/brave-chat-server_app4/web
```

Push containers to docker hub:

```sh
docker push registry.heroku.com/app1/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/app2/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/app3/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/app4/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/lb/web
```

Deploy containers on Heroku:

```sh
heroku container:push app1 --app ${your heroku app}
heroku container:push app2 --app ${your heroku app}
heroku container:push app3 --app ${your heroku app}
heroku container:push app4 --app ${your heroku app}
heroku container:push lb --app ${your heroku app}
```

Todo: Figure out a better way to deploy multiple containers on Heroku because the above didn't work(it seems like it is not possible).

### Vercel (Not Possible)

This project makes use of WebSockets, which are unforunately not supported by Vercel's serverless functions.

[![Deploy on Vercel](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f209ca5cc3af7dd930b6bfc55b3d7b6a5fde1aff/68747470733a2f2f76657263656c2e636f6d2f627574746f6e)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/brave-chat/brave-chat-server)

### Netlify (Not Possible)

This project makes use of WebSockets, which are unforunately not supported by Netlify's serverless functions.

Additionally, running a FastAPI app is not possible on Netlify because the app consists of server side rendering. Only client side rendering is currently allowed on Netlify, which means that you can only deploy statically generated websites like docs and such. I tried to hack my way around it by creating a serverless function that executes `uvicorn main:app --reload` in the background. However, the serverless function is being deployed on a different environment.

[![Deploy on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/brave-chat/brave-chat-server)
